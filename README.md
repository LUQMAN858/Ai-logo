# Simple AI Logo Generator (GitHub-ready)

This small project generates 10 SVG logo variations from a prompt and allows downloading the selected SVG.

## How to deploy (GitHub + Render)
1. Create a new GitHub repository and upload these files.
2. On Render.com connect your GitHub repo and create a Web Service.
   - Build command: `npm install`
   - Start command: `npm start`
3. After deploy, open the live URL and use the box to generate logos.

## AdSense
- Publisher ID already inserted (ca-pub-7200904502577067). Replace `REPLACE_WITH_AD_SLOT_ID` with your ad unit id.

## Notes
- This generator is procedural and simple; for higher-quality logos integrate an AI image API.
- Clear the storage folder periodically if you have many generated files.
